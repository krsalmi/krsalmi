### Hello! :sunny:

I'm Kristiina, a professional oboe player turned programming student at [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en/)! :musical_note: :point_right: üë©‚Äçüíª  
I enjoy learning and channelling my creativity towards coding and problem solving. Soon I will be finishing the first leg of my studies at Hive and it will be time for me to find an internship where I can put my knowledge into action and learn completely new things!

## üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on...  

-[Reedtracker](http://www.reedtracker.com/), a Python Flask application, where oboe players can register to track the details of the reeds they are making. You can watch a little Youtube video presentation [here](https://youtu.be/XY-WkgoZPtU). Coded in Python, MySQL, Flask, HTML, CSS, Javascript  

-a school project called [Corewar](https://github.com/ninjapiraatti/corewar) with a team of talented coders. In this project, we must build a virtual memory arena (basically a Virtual Machine) in which different programs will be executed and "fight each other" by performing op codes and overwriting the memory area. We must also create an assembler to compile assembly code into bytecode. Coded in C 

## üå± Other things I‚Äôm currently studying ...
-Elements of AI, the course of understading the basics of artificial intelligence from University of Helsinki and Reaktor

## :white_check_mark: Courses I've completed...
-CS50 from Harvard University, basics of computer science

## :mega: Languages and frameworks I've worked with..
-C, this is the main language we are learning in Hive Helsinki
