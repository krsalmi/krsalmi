### Hello! :sunny:

I'm Kristiina, professional oboe player turned programmer! :musical_note: :point_right: üë©‚Äçüíª  
I've been working as a software engineer for over 2 years, and I'm also part of the [Hive Helsinki](https://www.hive.fi/en/) alumni. I enjoy learning and channelling my creativity towards coding and problem solving. Lately, I have been very curious about AI and I have been studying the fundamentals on my own.

## üî≠ Some projects I'd like to tell you about...  

-[AI Digit Recognition Web App](https://digitrecognition-ai.onrender.com), an application that uses machine learning to recognize handwritten digits. The frontend, built with React, allows users to draw digits on a canvas and send the drawing to a backend Python Flask server to predict what digit they drew using a pre-trained machine learning model.
Users can also try retraining the model themselves. You can check out the code for both the [frontend](https://github.com/krsalmi/ai_digits_frontend.git) and the [backend](https://github.com/krsalmi/ai_digits_backend.git).

-[Nim](https://github.com/krsalmi/nim.git), a Python program of the classic game, Nim, with an AI player, trained with reinforcement learning (Q learning).

-[Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/krsalmi/tictactoe.git), the game as a Python program with an AI player, written using the minimax algorithm.

-[Reedtracker](http://www.reedtracker.com/), a Python Flask application, where oboe players can register to track the details of the reeds they are making. You can watch a little Youtube video presentation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX4bWLfkhLs). Coded in Python, MySQL, Flask, HTML, CSS, Javascript 

-[WeShare](https://github.com/krsalmi/weshare), my own modified version of a cost-sharing app, which receives information from command line arguments. In this program, it‚Äôs also possible to adjust the share of participants. Written in Python. 

-[Corewar](https://github.com/ninjapiraatti/corewar), a team project for school in which we coded our own assembler and a Virtual Machine to play our version of the legendary memory conquering game, Core War. I was mostly in charge of the creation of the Virtual Machine and the Visualizer built to accompany it. Written in C.
